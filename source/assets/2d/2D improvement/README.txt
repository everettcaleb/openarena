Credits go to Schlorri, his armor and medkit icons were used as a reference. The other pictures are OpenArena's picture remade or my creations.

Description: 
This patch was made for OpenArena 0.8.1. It contains replacement of some 2D graphics and textures which can be improved. The patch won't change the theme of the game and doesn't contains higher resolution images than the 0.8.1 had.
