The reason they are in ACD-ZIP format is because I made these songs using some of my loops, with ACID Music Studio, also the file reads the files in relativity, so you'd have to have the same path as me to read the wav files. However, anyone can open up the ACD-ZIP file without problems, and you can do it for free with ACID Xpress, which can be found with a simple Google search, however, you will require WINE, or to be running Windows to open it. (I'm not sure if WINE supports it).
