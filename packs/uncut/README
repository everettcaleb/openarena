What is uncut pack?
-------------------

	This is the pack of stuff that was cut out of OpenArena's releases which were edited for content to get around more. The same sources are used. 

What this pack has:
-------------------

	- Restores nudity on Arachna, and Arachna/widowe
	- Restores nudity on Gargoyle
	- "Holy shit" instead of "Holy crap" 
	- Skelebot's original taunt is back
	- Restores nudity on Ayumi, Ayumi/neko
	- Restores trimmed clothes on Ayumi/red
	- Adds nudity to Angelyss, Angelyss/dark

-----------------------------------------------------

	Because they were never cut in the first place :)
