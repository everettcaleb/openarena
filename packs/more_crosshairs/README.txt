this will add 60 new crosshairs to OA

the same as the default ones but with effect colors

red (being the most important one), yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple

i did this for corkscrew (which is 1.27 based) already
and added the patch... please apply it manually and test...

having so many crosshairs supported by the qvm people
can add custom crosshairs to their servers without
overriding the default OA crosshairs...

i also fixed the headers of crosshair a,b,c and d which seemed to be
broken... (didn't load in my gimp(!))
