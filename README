==FAQ==
===I can't use the mouse in windowed mode!===
This is a known issue (a last minute bug discovery in fact) and will be fixed in a upcoming hotfix. 

===There's some missing textures===
Yeah :(

===I WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS YOU OWE ME MONEY.===
$0 budget, spare time, and less than 6 active contributors kinda make things hard :)

===I can only be Kyonshi and Sergei in Missionpack! What gives!===
James and Janet aren't modeled yet, so for the gameplay code to even function we have to depend on these two player models.

===YOU STOLE THOSE QUAKE MAPS!!! IM TELLING ID SOFTWARE YOUR IN BIG TORUBLE MISTER.===
John Romero released them under the GNU GPL v2, and since they're timeless deathmatch classics we couldn't resist porting a few of them over. If you're going to pull a [citation needed], here's a URL for you:

===Where did q3dm6ish go?===
As if! It's here and looking AWESOME thanks to TRaK.

===Where did void4 go?===
Textures mysteriously broke :\ it's also a bad level

===Where did Ayumi\Neko go?===
Her skin sucked, and Ayumi is going through a change into a new mesh so this skin would be abandoned in advance. Plus neko looks better on angelyss anyway :)

===Where did Ayumi\Jenna go?===
In this version, to save space and gain more FPS we had to delete the 'body' out of Ayumi's torso and merge the remainder with the shirt. Unfortunately this broke the Jenna skin and as such we have to remove it. :(
Ayumi still doesn't look good, and needs a remake from scratch anyway.

===This game is a big crap! Everything is not consistent!! its to wacky and fruty!!!===
Well, the original game is also as equally as inconsistent and wacky (and due to this we are free to have so much creative variety in this one), we're just not paid hundred-thousands to work on it to make it 'look good'.

===I don't like Angelyss and Arachna! Too much!!!===
You can remove pak2-players-mature.pk3 from your baseoa directory. Be warned though, you won't be able to join pure servers without using this pk3 file.
