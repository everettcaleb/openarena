FAQ:

Q: Where did Tux go? :(
A: He's removed mainly because
   1. I have lost the original source files
   2. He's small
   3. it's a crappy model
  He'll be remade eventually
UPDATE: I have recovered the source .ms3d files of the Tux model :) but it's a piece of crap :(

Q: There's some missing textures
A: Yeah :(

Q: Where did OA_BASES3 (The CTF level) go?
A: I couldn't solve its spawnpoint bug problem which give the red team a huge advantage so I left it out in arenas.txt. It's back to DM only OA i guess.
