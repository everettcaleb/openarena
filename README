==FAQ==
===There's some missing textures===
Yeah :(

===Where did OA_BASES3 (The CTF level) go?===
It's back! And better than ever !!!

===Where did q3dm6ish go?===
The texturing was pretty bad, and since I finally realized the original textures that Aardappel made used for it were in Public Domain so i'll just reimport the old map structures with old textures and convert that later.

===Where did void4 go?===
Textures mysteriously broke :\

===I don't like Angelyss and Arachna! Too much!!!===
You can remove pak2-players-mature.pk3 from your baseoa directory. Be warned though, you won't be able to join pure servers without using this pk3 file.
