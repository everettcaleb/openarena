==FAQ==
===There's some missing textures===
Yeah :(

===Where did OA_BASES3 (The CTF level) go?===
I couldn't solve its spawnpoint bug problem which give the red team a huge advantage so I left it out in arenas.txt. It's back to DM only OA i guess.

===Where did q3dm6ish go?===
The texturing was pretty bad, and since I finally realized the original textures that Aardappel made used for it were in Public Domain so i'll just reimport the old map structures with old textures and convert that later.

===Where did void4 go?===
Textures mysteriously broke :\
